# DemographicDataAnalyser
This project analyses a census dataset using Pandas. It returns information such as the average age of men, the percentage of people with a degree, the percentage of people who earn more than $50,000 per year, and the most popular occupation in a given country.



This project is for the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python course.
